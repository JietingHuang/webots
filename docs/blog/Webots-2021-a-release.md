## ROS 2 & Webots

We are continuing to develop and improve the support for ROS 2 in Webots with now [13 Webots packages for ROS 2](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2).
This version of Webots is fully compatible with [ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Releases/Release-Foxy-Fitzroy).

- We are happy to participate to [Google Season of Docs](https://cyberbotics.com/gsod) this year!
Thanks to the [Soft illusion YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrl9pLcAAKy8wuXkN-on3xQ) channel a serie of video tutorials about ROS2 and Webots is now available.
Check [the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt69C9MnPchkP0ZXZOqmIGRTOch8o9GiQ) and learn about ROS2 basics, how to create a Webots ROS2 driver, how to do SLAM, or follow AR tags. 
- We also signficantly enchanged and refactored our documentation for the [webots\_ros2](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2) package.
References, examples, and tutorials, are now gathered to [a single place](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/wiki) with a clean overview.
- We improved performances of the Lidar node by over 7 times.
- The InertialUnit node now returns quaternions making it easier to use in ROS2 nodes.
